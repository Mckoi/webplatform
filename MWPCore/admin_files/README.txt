
Mckoi Web Platform Node Installation Utility
--------------------------------------------

This is the Mckoi Web Platform node installation tool. It helps you set up
a server to operate both a MckoiDDB node (a distributed database) and a MWP
node (a distributed web application server running over MckoiDDB).

To run the installation utility use the 'nodeinstall' command from a Linux
or Windows command line.
